I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/).
My research interest includes Machine Learning, Deep Learning. Specially, I focus on Mechanistic Interpretability: to reverse engineer neural network, especially Transformer which is widely used in LLMs. 

Here's my [CV](http://xintianpan.github.io/files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). If you have the same research interest, feel free to contact me!

Here's the demo for my ongoing research [Demo](https://xintianpan.github.io/html/demo.html)
